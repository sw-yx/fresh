# The fresh manifesto

If you want your list to be included on **fresh**, try to only include actual fresh stuff in your list. After all, it's a **live curation, not a museum**.

But **what is fresh?**

## The **fresh** standard v0.2

- **fresh** as in **new**: **Every link must display an accompanying date**. For blogposts, talks or other content with a definite date, that is easy. For github projects or websites that are potentially evergreen, the date is the last date where the maintainer(s) have verified freshness.
  - long lists should split links out by topic, at maintainer's discretion.
- **fresh** as in **good**: It is the responsibility of the maintainer to keep a high quality bar. This is necessarily subjective and imperfect. It also means people should fork `fresh` lists if they feel they can do a better job of maintaining.
- **when stuff goes stale**: They get relegated to a `History` topic which is in chronological order for future readers to peruse. If really awesome stuff is going stale, too bad: get someone to make an updated talk or blogpost to replace it. Let the old make way for the new.

## Fresh summary

Once you subjectively have enough content that it starts getting difficult to hold everything in your head, start writing an aggregated summary briefing on the topic. Use the links you have accumulated just like a wiki.

## Comment on why something is fresh

Apart from suggesting a particular item on your list, you should also inform your readers *why* it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.

## Make it clear what the list is about

Have a succinct description at the top of your readme. Make sure your list covers a certain scope and nothing else. Link to other `fresh` lists if you think they already cover a certain subject well enough.

## Pay attention to grammar

Ensure your list is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors. This should also apply to pull requests.

## Choose an appropriate license

Keep in mind that if you [haven't selected a license](http://choosealicense.com/no-license/), it basically means the people are *not* allowed to reproduce, distribute or create derivative works.

[Creative Commons licenses](https://creativecommons.org/) are perfect for this purpose. **We would recommend [`CC0`](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).** Code licenses like MIT, BSD, GPL, and so forth are not recommended.

## Include contribution guidelines

People who are contributing to your list should have a clear understanding of how they should do so.

If you don't feel like writing one from scratch, feel free to take our [contributing.md](contributing.md) and modify it to your own needs.

## Stylize your list properly

Create a [table of contents](https://github.com/sindresorhus/stuff/blob/master/toc-generators.md), organize the content into different categories, and use images if suitable. Ensure all entries are consistent (e.g. all entry descriptions end in a `.`).

## Accept other people's opinion

If you're an owner of the list, respect other people's opinion. If there are plenty of users not agreeing to your decision, give it a second thought.
